# Learn CPP
## Instruction
Unix based os with g++ command.
For compiling use `g++  <filename>.cpp` and for execution use `./a.out`

## About C++
- C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It is an extension to C programming.
- C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.
- C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.

## Usage of C++

By the help of C++ programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:

-   Window application
-   Client-Server application
-   Device drivers
-   Embedded firmware etc

## 1.Basics
- **print.cpp** - Printing string program using iostream.
- **print1.cpp** - Printing string without using namespace and iostream.
- **print1.cpp** - Printing string without using stdio header.
- **dataType.cpp** - Prints size of different data types.
- **integer.cpp** - Prints size of different data types of integer.
- **integer1.cpp** - Type conversion from binary to integer.
- **variable.cpp** - Store values in different variables.
- **floatCaution.cpp** - Things you should be careful about while using float values.
- **const.cpp** - Demonstrated about const.
- **array.cpp** - Demonstrated array type.
- **2darray.cpp** - Demonstrated 2D array type.
- **vector.cpp** - Demonstrate Vector data type.
- **vector.cpp** - Demonstrate list data type.
- **map.cpp** - Demonstrate map data type.
- **read.cpp** - For reading inputs. 
- **read1.cpp** - For reading inputs using stdheader.
- **operators.cpp** - Types of operators.
- **bitwise.cpp** - Demonstrate bitwise operation.
- **condition.cpp** - Different conditional statements.
- **PostAndPre.cpp** - Demonstrated post and pre increment of integer variable.
- **loops.cpp** - Different types of loop.
- **loops1.cpp** - Controlling loops execution (break and continue).
- **range.cpp** - Iteration using range.
- **function.cpp** - Demonstrate to create and call integer multiplication function.
- **functionOverloading.cpp** - Demonstrate function overloading.
- **exit.cpp** - To quit program.
- **file.cpp** -  Opening and writing file.
- **filer.cpp** -  Opening and reading file.
- **headerDemo.cpp** - Demonstrate how to call user defined header function from main.
- **cpp2cpp.cpp** - Communication of one cpp to another cpp, for execution use `g++ cpp2cpp.cpp headers/function.cpp`.
- **class.cpp** - Demonstrated how to create student class  with setters and getters.
- **constructorOverloading.cpp** - Demonstrated constructor overloading
- **accessSpecifier.cpp** - Encapsulation
- **stringManipulation.cpp** - Demonstration of applying string manipulation functions.
- **destructor.cpp** - Demonstration of how destructors work.
- **struct.cpp** - Demonstration of  struct.
- **cli.cpp** - Command line arguments.
- **For Saving complied code** -  use `g++ <filename>.cpp -o <outFilename>`.
- **pointer.cpp** - Demonstrate pointer and reference for memory access.
- **arrayPointer.cpp** - Demonstrate array using pointer.
- **rangeAndPointer.cpp** - Demonstrate array using pointer and range.
- **exception.cpp** - Demonstrate try and catch block to catch exception.
- **memory.cpp** - Demonstrated memory management using calloc,malloc and realloc.


 ## 2. Advance CPP
- **qualifier** - There are 2 type of qualifier :- Modification and life duration qualifiers 
- **Modification qualifiers** - There are 3 type of Modification qualifier :- Const, volatile, mutable
- **Life duration qualifiers** - There are 3 type of Life duration qualifiers :- static, register, extern
- **const.cpp** - Demonstrated const qualifier. Value of object or variable will remain constant through out. 
- **volatile.cpp** - Demonstrated volatile qualifier. Generally used for multi-threaded application
- **mutable.cpp** - Demonstrated mutable qualifier. It permits modification of the class member declared mutable even if the containing object is declared const.
- **static.cpp** - Demonstrated static qualifier. A static member is shared by all objects of the class.
- **register.cpp** - Demonstrated register qualifier. It is generally used for making system drivers.
- **extern.cpp** - Demonstrated extern qualifier. It let us access members from header file.
- **assertions.cpp** - Assert will terminate the program if its argument turns out to be false.
- **gdb.cpp** - Terminal Based debugger.
- **memCheck.cpp** - Using valgrind to run memcheck on verify.cpp.


 ## 3. Threading and makefile
 - **thread_id.cpp** - Obtainting id of thread process and number of threads available in cpu.
 - **basic.cpp** - Basics to use threading.
 - **Makefile** - Basics to use threading.
